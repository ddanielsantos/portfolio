## My personal portfolio
The project was made using Vite and ReactJS, and it's hosted on [Github Pages](https://ddanielsantos.github.io/fuzzy-octo-succotash/), the main configuration to do this was in the `vite.config.ts` file, to more information check [this](https://dev.to/yuribenjamin/how-to-deploy-react-app-in-github-pages-2a1f) article which I used.
